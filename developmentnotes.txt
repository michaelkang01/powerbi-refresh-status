#Property of Questrade

These are just some observations and notes for the python script should it be handed off to someone else.
There are a few things that access is required for, namely:
Google Cloud Services
Git
Datadog

How the Questrade Pipeline works is like this:
1. Code is sent to the Git
https://git.questrade.com/engineering/BI/Prod/pbi-collector/powerbi-refresh-status
2. The CloudInfra team helps setup the pipeline on Jenkins.
http://jenkins.q3.questech.io:8080/view/Data%20Masters/job/powerbi-refresh-status/
3. If  successful, the program is ran on Google's Kubernetes system.
4. Logs can be found on Datadog by searching the service's name.

5. The BigQuery results are found on Google Cloud Services. (in qt-msa-nonprod-6f)
